This also means my responses today might be different from responses I would have given a few months ago!\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **I'm designed to be helpful and informative, but I can also be creative.** I can write poems, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I can even try to imitate different writing styles. The only limit is the data I have access to and my programming.\n",
